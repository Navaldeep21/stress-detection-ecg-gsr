# Stress Detection using ECG and GSR

This project uses machine learning techniques to detect stress levels based on physiological signals — ECG (Electrocardiogram) and GSR (Galvanic Skin Response). Conducted as part of the COEN691 course.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Clean and process ECG & GSR data
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Extract meaningful features
- Train ML models to classify stress
- Evaluate model performance

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Results

Achieved approximately **90% accuracy** in classifying stress levels using SVM and Random Forest models.

## 📁 Structure

- `COEN691_ECG_GSR.ipynb` – Main notebook with all analysis
